<p>External account passwords can be decrypted using a Cipher. This function is deprecated since version 1.0.0 since it's not guaranteed to work in future versions of Campaign (V8 and above)</p>

<pre class="code">
const cipher = await client.getSecretKeyCipher();
const password = cipher.decryptPassword(encryptedPassword);
</pre>

<p class="warning">This function is deprecated in version 1.0.0 of the SDK because it may break as we deploy Vault.</p>

<p>In order to set the password of an external account, you can use the <b>encryptPassword</b> API as follow</p>

<pre class="code">
const password = await this._client.NLWS.xtkSession.encryptPassword('password');
const account = {
    xtkschema: "nms:extAccount",
    name: name,
    account: 'admin',
    server: server,
    password: password,
};
await this._client.NLWS.xtkSession.Write(account);
</pre>
