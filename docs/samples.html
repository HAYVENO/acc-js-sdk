title: Sample Code
---

<p>The <b>samples</b> folder contains several samples illustrating how to use the various Campaign APIs.</p>

<p>A sample file looks like this</p>

<ul>
<li>It includes the <b>utils</b> library which contains a few helper functions.s</li>
<li>It starts with an asynchronous auto-execute function that is used to run the sample from the command line</li>
<li>This function contains one or more calls to the <b>utils.sample</b> function. Each such call describes and execute a sample.</li>
<li>A sample file should not do anything else or have any side effect: all the actual sample code should be inside calls to <b>utils.sample</b></li>
</ul>

<p class="info"> Note the use of <b>await</b> when calling <b>utils.sample</b></p>

<pre class="code">
const utils = require("./utils.js");
( async () => {
  await utils.sample({
    title: "The Sample title",
    labels: [ "xtk:queryDef", "Basics", "Query", "QueryDef", "Get" ],
    description: `A description of the sample`,
    code: async() => {
      //... Sample code goes there
    }
  });

  await utils.sample({
    title: "A Second sample",
    labels: [ "xtk:queryDef", "Basics", "Query", "QueryDef", "Get" ],
    description: `A description of the sample`,
    code: async() => {
      //... Sample code goes there
    }
  });
})();
</pre>

<p>The <b>utils.sample</b> function takes 1 parameters describing the sample:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>title</b> is the sample title, a short, human friendly name for the sample</li>
<li><b>labels</b> is a list of keywords that can be used to retreive the samples in a large list</li>
<li><b>description</b> is a longer, multi-line description of the sample</li>
<li><b>code</b> is an async function, the code of the sample</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the samples - actually all of them except some specific samples needing specific logon - will also use the `utils.logon` function. This is a helper function which will perform the Campaign Logon and Logoff for you, and call your callback function with pre-initialized `client` and `NLWS` objects</p>

<p class="info"> Note the use of <b>await</b> when calling <b>utils.logon</b></p>

<pre class="code">
  await utils.sample({
    title: "The Sample title",
    labels: [ "xtk:queryDef", "Basics", "Query", "QueryDef", "Get" ],
    description: `A description of the sample`,
    code: async() => {
      return await utils.logon(async (client, NLWS) => {
          //... Sample code goes there
      });
    }
  });
</pre>


<h1>Running samples</h1>
<p>Samples can be run from the command line. First, set 3 environment variables with your instance credentials:</p>

<pre class="code">
export ACC_URL=https://myInstance.campaign.adobe.com
export ACC_USERadmin
export ACC_PASSWORD=...
</pre>

<p>and then run the samples</p>
<pre class="code">
node samples/000\ -\ basics\ -\ logon.js
</pre>`
