<h1>The Campaign Object model</h1>
<p>
  Campaign has schemas to describe every piece of data. For instance recipients have a schema : nms:recipient. Even Schemas
  have their own schema (xtk:schema). A Campaign schema is more than just a description of the data, the available properties
  of an entity and their types. Campaign schemas are really similar to classes in an object model: they describe the data
  of course, but they also contain <b>methods</b> which will be made available automatically as SOAP APIs. Schemas also
  support an inheritance mechanism, including the notion of <b>interface</b>. An interface is simply a descrption of one or
  several methods. Schemas inheriting the interface will inherit their methods.
</p> 

<h1>Campaign SOAP APIs</h1>

<p>
  Campaign SOAP APIs are not REST APIs. Not only, we're using SOAP and XML, but Campaign also uses a very different model for APIs. 
  In fact we use a object oriented model, i.e. APIs in Campaign are closer to remote methods invocation than REST APIs are. For
  instance, imagine what a REST API call to retreive a profile would look like. You'll probably issue a GET operation on the profile
  resource with a more or less sophisticated mechanism to filter the selected profile based on query parameters. 
</p>
<p>
  In Campaign, you'll execute a query. You are going to use the <b>ExecuteQuery</b> method of the <b>xtk:queryDef</b> schema. This
  API actually directly matches the method VExecuteQuery of the XtkQueryDef class of the C++ code. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
  &lt;srcSchema <span class="emphasis">namespace="xtk"</span> <span class="emphasis">name="queryDef"</span> implements="xtk:persist">
    &lt;element name="queryDef" pkgStatus="never">...&lt;/element>
    &lt;methods async="true">
      &lt;method <span class="emphasis">name="ExecuteQuery"</span> const="true">
        &lt;parameters>
          &lt;param desc="Output XML document" name="output" type="DOMDocument" inout="out"/>
        &lt;/parameters>
      &lt;/method>
      ...
    &lt;/methods>
  &lt;/srcSchema>
</pre>
<p class="caption">This is the <b>xtk:queryDef</b> source schema, which defines the <b>ExecuteQuery</b> method</p>

<p>
  To name APIs, we use the convention <b>{schemaId}#{methodName}</b>. For instance, the <b>ExecuteQuery</b> method of the 
  <b>xtk:queryDef</b> schema is named by its <b>URN</b>: <b>xtk:queryDef#ExecuteQuery</b>. The <b>URN</b> is an important concept
  and is passed to every SOAP call through the <b>SOAPAction</b> HTTP header.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes, methods which are inherited from an interface. For example the Write method is defined in the xtk:persist interface which is
  implemented by the xtk:session schema. For such methods, the URN is <b>xkt:persist|xtk:session#Write</b>, where we have both the interface
  id and the schema id separated by a pipe character.
</p>

<pre class="code">
  &lt;srcSchema namespace="xtk" name="queryDef"</span> <span class="emphasis">implements="xtk:persist"</span>>
    ...
  &lt;/srcSchema>
</pre>
<p class="caption">Thee <b>xtk:queryDef</b> inherits the <b>xtk:persist</b> interface</p>

<p>
  Regarding schema inheritance, it is possible to define custom methods in derived schemas. For example, a customer may extend
  the nms:recipient schema with an extension schema named cus:recipient, and may declare one or more custom methods in this extension 
  schema. Such methods will of course be exposed as SOAP APIs, but they are available on the base schema only, i.e. on nms:recipient
  and not on cus:recipipent. The reason for this is that Campaign actually merges all the schemas and their extensions (which we all
  call source schemas, by the way) into the actual schema which takes the name of the base source schema. As a consequence, the
  SDK actually always deal with schemas, and not source schemas, although it is also possible to handle source schemas by calling
  the appropriate APIs.

<h1>Representations</h1>

<p>
The SDK works with the underlying notion of <b>representation</b>. Internally, Campaign uses XML to represent all entities. 
Using XML is fine, but nowadays, people find it complicated and verbose and prefer to use JSON.
</p>
<p>
The SDK is able to handle both XML and JSON representation for Campagin objects. It defaults to JSON, which means you pass JSON
objects to the SDK and it returns JSON objects, and takes care of the JSON <=> XML conversion automatically. The SDK is not limited
to JSON, but can use XML instead (DOM API) if you change the representation. 
</p>

<p>3 type of representation are handled by the SDK</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>SimpleJson</b> representation, which is the default is used to deal with JSON instead of XML</li>
  <li>The <b>xml></b> representation is used to deal with XML. In fact it does not transform anything, this is the native language of Campaign</li>
  <li>The <b>BadgerFish</b> representation, which is an alternative variant of JSON and is deprecated. It's only there for backwards compatibility</li>
</ul>

<h1>Asynchronous API</h1>

<p>
  The JS SDK provides an asynchronous API, which means most of the functions return promises. 
  In particular, many functions in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/application.html">Application API</a> return promises.
</p>
<p>
  This is an important difference between the SDK and Campaign. The reason is that the JavaScript which runs inside
  Campaign is running server side and is synchronous. The SDK however, is running outside of Campaign and needs to
  be able to wait for the result of API calls.
