<h1>Start with the concepts</h1>

<p></p>
<p class="ref">Start with the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/concepts.html">concepts</a> behind Campaign and the SDK.</p>





<h1>API limits</h1>

<p>
    Most of the Campaign APIs are not meant for high volume, low concurrency processing. For instance, we 
    provide APIs to create recipients. However, this is not meant to be used as a streaming ingestion
    API, i.e. you do not want to use this API to insert large amount of recipients. This kind of operation
    should still be done in batch, using workflows.
</p>

<p>
    However, the APIs are well fit to use for use cases such as an UI, Landing pages, within the provisioned
    capacity.
</p>




<h1>XML or JSON</h1>

<p>
    The SDK supports both JSON and XML. Campaign internally uses XML, so it's always more accurate to use XML.
    However it's not as simple to use XML as it is to use JSON. Still, the SDK provides several
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/domHelper.html">helpers</a> do deal with XML in a simple way.
</p>

<p>
    You can use either one or both, however, it's a good idea to undestand the gotchas of using JSON. It
    may seem easier than XML, but there are a few gotchas which makes this not an obvious choice. 
</p>

<p class="ref">Understand the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/domHelper.html">DOM helpers</a> to make your life simpler with XML</p>



<h1>Data types</h1>

<p>
    The SDK will not always return the proper data types. For instance, it may return a string instead of a 
    number, an object in place of an array, etc.
</p>

<p>
    Those are all consequences of using XML in the first place (attribute values are all serialized as strings)
    but also of transforming XML to JSON and back.
</p>

<p>
    Dealing with those inconsistencies in the application code can be challenging: it's difficult to always
    keep them in mind and error-prone to rely on such rigor to make sure things are always correct.
</p>

<p>
    Let's take as an example a <b>condition</b> object. This is usually used in queries to filter the
    result, but is also available at many other places, such as sys filters, delivery targets, etc. The
    <b>condition</b> object is defined in the xtk:queryDef schema from which there's an extract below.
</p>

<pre class="code">
&lt;element name="condition">
    &lt;attribute name="expr" type="string" label="Expression"/>
    &lt;attribute name="ignore" <span class="emphasis">type="boolean"</span> label="Ignore condition"/>
    ...
    <span class="emphasis">
    &lt;element ref="xtk:queryDef:condition" name="condition" ordered="true" unbound="true"/>
    </span>
    ...
&lt;/element>
</pre>

<p>
    In this example, we see two things: the ignore attribute is a boolean, and conditions are recursive objects
    which can contain sub conditions. We also see that the <b>condition</b> node is a collection, i.e. that there
    can be zero, one or more sub-conditions (unbound="true")
</p>

<pre class="code">
&lt;condition>                               <span class="comment">&lt;-- I have exactly one child element --></span>
    &lt;condition boolOperator="AND">        <span class="comment">&lt;-- I have exactly two children elements --></span>
        &lt;condition boolOperator="OR" ignore="false" expr=.../>
        &lt;condition boolOperator="OR" ignore="1" expr=.../>
    &lt;/condition>
&lt;/condition>
</pre>
<p class="caption">An example of a condition object in XML</p>

<p>
    What this example shows that the ignore attribute, which is a boolean, can have a variety of values, such a "true", "false", "1", "0", etc. 
    We also see that the first level of condition (with AND operator) has 2 children, but the top level condition has only one children.
</p>

<p>
    In JSON, such an object will become this
</p>

<pre class="code">
const condition = {
    condition: {
        boolOperator: "AND",
        condition: [
            { boolOperator: "OR", ignore: "false", expr:"..." },
            { boolOperator: "OR", ignore: "1", expr:"..." },
        ]
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
    As you can see, the SDK did not realize that the ignore property is a boolean, and did not cast it for you. Similarly, it did not 
    realize that the condition element is a collection (an array), and has generated both an array (for the two OR conditions) and
    an object (for the AND condition).
</p>

<p>
    This can become quickly very hard to use. For instance, if I want to test the ignore boolean, I need to write
</p>

<pre class="code">
const ignore = condition.condition.condition[0].ignore;
if (ignore == "true" || ignore == "1") {
    ...
}
</pre>


<p>
    One would want to simply test ignore as a boolean, and you can (should) use the XTK caster to force the conversion
</p>

<pre class="code">
const ignore = XtkCaster.asBoolean(condition.condition.condition[0].ignore);
if (ignore) {
    ...
}
</pre>

<p>
    In fact, you should use XtkCaster for the condition objects which are potential arrays, as follows
</p>

<pre class="code">
    const ignore = XtkCaster.asBoolean(
        XtkCaster.asArray(
            XtkCaster.asArray(condition.condition)
            .condition
        )[0].ignore);
    if (ignore) {
        ...
    }
</pre>

<p>
    This is a little bit hard to read. It's better to create an object model and make sure data is casted to the proper types
    as the objects are constructed.
</p>

<pre class="code">
const makeCondition = (condition) => {
    if (condition === null || condition === undefined) return condition;
    return {
        boolOperator: XtkCaster.asString(condition.boolOperator),
        ignore: XtkCaster.asBoolean(condition.ignore),
        condition: makeCondition(condition.condition);
    };
}
const safeCondition = makeCondition(condition);
expect(safeCondition.ignore).toBe(false);
</pre>
