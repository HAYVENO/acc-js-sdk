title: BadgerFish format
---

<p>
  To distinguish between BadgerFish and SimpleJson format, all BadgerFish objects will have the BadgerFishObject class, that includes the top-level object, but also all children objects. A badgerfish object can be created as follows. It will automatically convert all the object literals into BadgerFishObjet class.
</p>

<p class="warning">BadgerFish representation is deprecated and only available for backwards compatibility reasons.</p>

<pre class="code">
const obj = new DomuUtil.BadgerFishObject({ "@att":"value });
</pre>
