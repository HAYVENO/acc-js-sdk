title: Method-level representation
---

<p>The client object is created with a default representation which is used for all API calls in the context of this client. Since version 1.1.2, it is also possible to set the representation at the method level, i.e. use a particular representation for a particular API call.</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>client.NLWS</b>: use the default representation set at the client level</li>
<li> <b>client.NLWS.xml</b>: use the XML reresentation</li>
<li> <b>client.NLWS.json</b>: use the SimpleJson representation</li>
</ul>
