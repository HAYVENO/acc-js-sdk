title: Session API
---

<p>The <b>xtk:session</b> schema contains APIs to manage sessions and connections to the Campaign server, plus some other general purpose APIs.</p>

<h1>Logging on and off</h1>

<p>
    The <b>xtk:session</b> schema contains all the methods for logging on and off. They are described in more details in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/connecting.html">Connecting to Campaign</a> page
</p>





<h1>Server time</h1>

<p>
    The <b>xtk:session#GetServerTime</b> API call returns the current data/time in the server (i.e. database) referential. This is a useful function
    to use to make sure all timestamps are in the same referential.
</p>

<pre class="code">
const timestamp = await NLWS.xtkSession.getServerTime();
console.log(`>> Server timestamp (UTC): ${timestamp.toUTCString()}`);
console.log(`>> Server timestamp (localized): ${timestamp}`);
</pre>
