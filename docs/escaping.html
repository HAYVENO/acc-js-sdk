<p>It's common to use variables in query conditions. For instance, in the above example, you'll want to query an account by name instead of using the hardcoded <b>ffda</b> name. The <b>expr</b> attribute takes an XTK expression as a parameter, and <b>ffda</b> is a string literal in an xtk expression.</p>

<p>To prevent xtk ingestions vulnerabilities, you should not concatenate strings and write code such as expr: "@name = '" + name + "'": if the value of the name 
  parameter contains single quotes, your code will not work, but could also cause vulnerabilities.
</p>


<h1>sdk.escapeXtk</h1>

<p>The <b>sdk.escapeXtk</b> can be used to properly escape string literals in xtk expressions. The function will also surround the escaped value with single quotes.</p>

<p>You can use string concatenation like this. Note the lack of single quotes around the value.</p>
<pre class="code">
{ expr: "@name=" + sdk.escapeXtk(name) }
</pre>

<p>or a template literal</p>
<pre class="code">
`{ expr: "@name=${sdk.escapeXtk(name)}" }`
</pre>

<p>The <b>escapeXtk</b> function can also be used to create tagged string literals. This leads to a much shorter syntax. Note that with this syntax, only the parameter values of the template literal are escaped</p>
<pre class="code">
sdk.escapeXtk`{ expr: "@name=${name}" }`
</pre>

<p>This can also be used to escape other data types such as timestamps</p>

<pre class="code">
  sdk.escapeXtk`{ expr: "@lastModified > = ${yesterday}" }`
</pre>

<p>will return</p>
<pre class="code">
{ expr: "@lastModified > = #2021-07-07T10:03:33.332Z# }`
</pre>


<h1>sdk.escapeForLike</h1>

<p>This function escapes values so that they can be used in SQL or XTK like conditions. For example a search term "term" can be escaped as follows to implement a search conditions</p>

<pre class="code">
expr: `Lower([${xpath}]) LIKE '%${sdk.escapeForLike(term)}%'`,
</pre>


<h1>sdk.expandXPath & sdk.unexpandXPath</h1>

<p>In Campaign, xpaths are used to access attributes of entities. When XPaths are used in XTK expressions, there can be ambiguities, for instance, in the expression "country/@name", is "country/@name" a xpath or are we dividing the variable country by the value of the attribute @name?</p>

<p>Amibiguity can be resolved by "expanding" the xpath from "country/@name" to "[country/@name]". The square brackets indicate an xpath.</p>

<pre class="code">
const expandedXPath = sdk.expandXPath(xpath);
const unexpandedXPath = sdk.unexpandXPath(expandedXPath);
</pre>



<h1>xtkConstText</h1>

<p>This function allows to convert literal values to xtk text constants, providing correct serialization. For instance, text constants will be quoted with single quotes, timestamps with the "#" character, etc.</p>

<pre class="code">
expect(sdk.xtkConstText("Hello", "string")).toBe("'Hello'");
expect(sdk.xtkConstText(-42.3, "double")).toBe("-42.3");
expect(sdk.xtkConstText("2022-02-15T09:49:04.000Z", "datetime"))
    .toBe("#2022-02-15T09:49:04.000Z#");
</pre>
