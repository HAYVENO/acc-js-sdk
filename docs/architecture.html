<p>
    The SDK is designed to be simple, small and ready to go. It does not depend on any piece of infrastructure, and is
    designed to be able to connect to any Campaign (Classic) version both from a server-side environment (node.js) or
    a client-side environment (browser).

<p class="caption">The architecture of the SDK</p>


<h1>Core principles</h1>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Small</b>: the bundle is kept intentionally small, with a minimum set of dependencies</li>
    <li><b>Quality</b>: the SDK is extensively tested, with hundreds of unit tests, and 100% coverage</li>
    <li><b>Vanilla JS</b>: the code is written in plain JavaScript with the minimum compilation phase</li>
    <li><b>Consistent</b>: we try to offer a consistent developer experience, both inside the SDK itself, but also with existing Campaign JavaScipt</li>
</ul>
