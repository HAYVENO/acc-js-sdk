title: Query API
---

<p>
    The <b>xtk:queryDef</b> schema contains generic methods to query the database and retrieve any kind of entites, both
    out-of-the-box and custom.
</p>

<p class="warning">This API is not meant for high concurrency. It is fit for a reasonble usage without the limits of the capacity you purchased.</p>

<p>List all accounts</p>

<pre class="code">
const queryDef = {
    schema: "nms:extAccount",
    operation: "select",
    select: {
        node: [
            { expr: "@id" },
            { expr: "@name" }
        ]
    }
};
const query = NLWS.xtkQueryDef.create(queryDef);

console.log(query);
const extAccounts = await query.executeQuery();
console.log(JSON.stringify(extAccounts));
</pre>

<p>Get a single record</p>
<pre class="code">
const queryDef = {
    schema: "nms:extAccount",
    operation: "get",
    select: {
        node: [
            { expr: "@id" },
            { expr: "@name" },
            { expr: "@label" },
            { expr: "@type" },
            { expr: "@account" },
            { expr: "@password" },
            { expr: "@server" },
            { expr: "@provider" },
        ]
    },
    where: {
        condition: [
            { expr: "@name='ffda'" }
        ]
    }
}
const query = NLWS.xtkQueryDef.create(queryDef);
const extAccount = await query.executeQuery();
</pre>



<h1>Query operations</h1>

<p>
    The <b>operation</b> attribute of a query indicates what kind of query operation to perform amongst the following. It is defined
    in the <b>xtk:queryDef:operation</b> enumeration.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>get</b> is used to query one and exactly one record. If the record does not exist, it is considered to be an error. If this happens, the SDK will actually throw a JavaScript error</li>
    <li><b>getIfExist</b> is used to query one record which may not exist</li>
    <li><b>select</b> is used to query multiple records. The result is an array of 0, 1, or more entities</li>
    <li><b>count</b> is used to count records</li>
</ul>


<h1>Escaping</h1>
<p>It's common to use variables in query conditions. For instance, in the above example, you'll want to query an account by name instead of using the hardcoded <b>ffda</b> name. The <b>expr</b> attribute takes an XTK expression as a parameter, and <b>ffda</b> is a string litteral in an xtk expression.</p>

<p>To prevent xtk ingestions vulnerabilities, you should not concatenate strings and write code such as expr: "@name = '" + name + "'": if the value of the name 
  parameter contains single quotes, your code will not work, but could also cause vulnerabilities.
</p>

<h1>Pagination</h1>
<p>Results can be retrieved in different pages, using the <b>lineCount</b> and <b>startLine</b> attributes. For instance, retrieves profiles 3 and 4 (skip 1 and 2)</p>

<pre class="code">
const queryDef = {
    schema: "nms:recipient",
    operation: "select",
    <span class="emphasis">lineCount: 2</span>,
    <span class="emphasis">startLine: 2</span>,
    select: {
        node: [
            { expr: "@id" },
            { expr: "@email" }
        ]
    }
}
const query = NLWS.xtkQueryDef.create(queryDef);
const recipients = await query.executeQuery();
console.log(JSON.stringify(recipients));
</pre>

<p class="warning">
    Campaign will automatically limit the number of row returned by a query to <b>200</b>. The reason for this limit is that
    all the data returned by a query is stored in memory in the application server, but is also sent over the network to
    the SDK or API client, which also stores the data in memory. Storing more than a few hundred rows is generally not a 
    good idea. Using the <b>QueryDef</b> API to handle large amounts of data is not a good idea either, it's better to 
    use workflow instead. Worfklows are made to process large amounts of data, up to hundreds of millions of rows, whereas
    queries are not meant to handle more than a few hundred rows.
</p>

<p>
    More advanced pagination also need a <b>orderBy</b> clause to ensure that results are consistent. If not using an orderBy
    clause, the query does not quarantee the ordering of the results, and subsequent calls are not quaranteed to 
    return consistent pages. This example uses the name attribute to sort delivery mappings and returns the first 2
    records.
</p>

<pre class="code">
const queryDef = {
    schema: "nms:deliveryMapping",
    operation: "select",
    <span class="emphasis">lineCount: 2</span>,
    select: {
        node: [
            { expr: "@id" },
            { expr: "@name" }
        ]
    },
    <span class="emphasis">
    orderBy: { node: [
        {expr: "@name"}
    ]}</span>
    };
</pre>


<h1>Conditionnal queries</h1>

<p>
    Some Campaign attributes depend on the installed packages. For instance, the mobile package will add attributes to
    various schemas so that Campaign can handle push notifications. I you need to write generic code that can adapt
    whether the mobile package is installed or not, you can use the <b>hasPackage</b> function to 
    conditionally add nodes to the query.
</p>

<pre class="code">
if (client.application.hasPackage("nms:mobileApp")) {
    queryDef.select.node.push({ expr: "@blackListAndroid" });
}  
</pre>




<h1>Select all fields</h1>

<p>
    For some objects, such as deliveries and workflows, it can be painful to have to list all the attributes that we want
    to retreive, as there could be hundreds. The query provides a mechanism to select all attributes, a bit like
    a SELECT * would do in SQL. However, it involves an extra API call <b>xtk:queryDef#SelectAll</b> which means an
    additional round-trip to the server
</p>

<pre class="code">
const queryDef = {
    schema: "xtk:option",
    operation: "get",
    where: {
        condition: [
            { expr:`@name='XtkDatabaseId'` }
        ]
    }
    }
    const query = NLWS.xtkQueryDef.create(queryDef);
    await query.selectAll(false);
    const databaseId = await query.executeQuery();
</pre>
<p class="caption">Querying all attributes of the xtk:option schema</p>




<h1>Generating the SQL of a query</h1>

<p>
    The queryDef API also lets you generate the SQL for a query, using the <b>BuildQuery</b>.
</p>


<pre class="code">
const sql = await query.buildQuery();
console.log(">> SQL query: " + sql);
</pre>


<p>
    The <b>BuildQueryEx</b> methods will also return the SQL and also metadata (data type) about each select field.
</p>

<pre class="code">
const sql = await query.buildQueryEx();
console.log(`>> SQL queryEx: "${sql[0]}"`);
console.log(`>> Format string: "${sql[1]}"`);
</pre>



<h1>The analyze option</h1>

<p>
    The query uses the <b>analyze</b> option to return user friendly names for enumerations. 
    In this example, we use the exclusionType attribute of the target mappings schema. Without the analyze flag, the query will
    return the numeric value of the attribute (for example 2). With the flag, the query will still return the numeric value,
    but will also return the string value of the attribute and its label. It will use addition JSON attributes named
    "exclusionTypeName" and "exclusionTypeLabel", using the "Name" and "Label" suffixes.`,
</p>

<pre class="code">
const queryDef = {
    schema: "nms:deliveryMapping",
    operation: "get",
    select: {
        node: [
            { expr: "@id" },
            { expr: "[storage/@exclusionType]", <span class="emphasis">analyze: true</span> },
        ]
    },
    where: {
        condition: [
            { expr:`@name='mapRecipient'` }
        ]
    }
}
query = NLWS.xtkQueryDef.create(queryDef);
mapping = await query.executeQuery();
</pre>
