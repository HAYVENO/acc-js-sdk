</pre>

<p>A workflow can be started with parameters. Variables, are passed as attributes of the parameters document.</p>
<pre class="code">
await NLWS.xtkWorkflow.startWithParameters(4900, { hello: "world" });
</pre>

<p>The variables can be used in the workflow as attributes of the <b>instance.vars</b> variable.</p>

logInfo(instance.vars.hello);
</pre>

<p class="warning">
    Note that workflows are executed asynchronously by Campaign. When the promise returned by the start
    function resolves, the workflow is not finished. The promise resolution indicates that the request
    to start (or stop) the workflow has been accepted by the server.
